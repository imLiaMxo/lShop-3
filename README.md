Version 2:
Version 2 of L-Shop 3 adds a new mode to the store, including prop animations for a window, and music. Edit this with the persist "Mode" or "SoundPath" if you wish for it to work. "SoundPath" (string) is the music played, feel free to set this to anything. (No MP3/Youtube links etc, but be in game.) Another thing added is silent scanning every certain time frame, which is set to 10 seconds, if the gun shop is NOT active and is sat on the home screen, every 10 seconds it will scan to see if any new shipments appear, or if more have been added.
